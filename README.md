Hi good people,
i am a programming enthusiast, i started learning python in 2018 and abandoned it in 2019, i have decided to pick it up again in 2021, this time around i will ensure i become very good at it. also i learnt git is a very important aspect in the development of a programming career. finally i am good in maths, i hope this makes me a better programmer.
